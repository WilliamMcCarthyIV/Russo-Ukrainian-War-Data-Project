Project Overview:
This portfolio project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data related to the Russo-Ukrainian War. The analysis includes exploring trends and patterns in infantry casualties over time, regional breakdown of infantry losses, aerial equipment losses, and ground equipment losses. The project utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for initial data analysis and Tableau for creating visualizations.

Jupyter Notebook Analysis:
1. Data Exploration:
The analysis begins with loading and exploring the dataset related to the Russo-Ukrainian War.
Initial data exploration involves examining key statistics, identifying missing values, and understanding the dataset's structure.
2. Data Cleaning:
Addressed missing values by replacing them with appropriate values (e.g., "0" for numerical columns).
Ensured data consistency and accuracy for effective analysis.
3. Summary Statistics:
Calculated summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation to gain insights into the central tendency and variability of the data.
Identified trends and patterns through exploratory data analysis.
4. Initial Visualizations:
Utilized Jupyter Notebooks to create preliminary visualizations, providing a quick overview of the dataset.
Tableau Visualizations:
1. Infantry Casualties Over Time (Line Chart):
Description:
Visualizes the trend of infantry casualties over time during the Russo-Ukrainian War.
Steps:
Loaded the cleaned dataset into Tableau.
Plotted a line chart with time (date) on the x-axis and infantry casualties on the y-axis.
Adjusted formatting, tooltips, and titles for clarity.
2. Regional Breakdown of Infantry Losses (Tree Map):
Description:
Represents the regional breakdown of infantry losses through a Tree Map.
Steps:
Utilized the cleaned dataset with geographic information.
Created a Tree Map with regions as categories and infantry losses determining rectangle sizes.
Customized formatting, tooltips, and labels for a clear representation.
3. Aerial Equipment Losses (Bar Chart):
Description:
Depicts the distribution of aerial equipment losses using a Bar Chart.
Steps:
Loaded the dataset and selected relevant columns.
Created a bar chart with aerial equipment types as categories and losses as the bar lengths.
Adjusted chart elements, colors, and tooltips.
4. Ground Equipment Losses (Bar Chart):
Description:
Illustrates the distribution of ground equipment losses using a Bar Chart.
Steps:
Loaded the dataset, focusing on columns related to ground equipment losses.
Developed a  Bar Chart with equipment types as columns and losses as the number as the bar lengths.
Fine-tuned formatting, labels, and tooltips.
Conclusion:
This portfolio project provides a comprehensive analysis and visualization of data related to the Russo-Ukrainian War. The Jupyter Notebooks offer initial insights, while Tableau visualizations provide a user-friendly and interactive dashboard for exploring key aspects of the conflict.
